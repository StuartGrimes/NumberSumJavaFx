## Synopsis

This project is a simple JavaFx application that adds three numbers.  Really its more about using JavaFx.  Learning points for me were :

* Setting column constraints relate to columns in the order in which the columnConstraint objects are created.

* Calling setPercentWidth on your columnConstraint object allows you to set how your column flexes within its parents node.

* Individual row settings can be set on nodes directly which will over write any column constraints set.
